- Sandbox tab: As you have created a new client, you will be added there by default. So now you can use the application via Instagram Authentication. If you want other users to use your application then you need to add their Instagram Username and those users need to accept your application invitation by login into Instagram Developer -> Sandbox Invites -> Accept Invitation(Refer below screenshots)
